				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<p>
					<!-- Currently, I am an Embedded System Engineer-Vehicle Software, at <a
						href="https://yatrimotorcycles.com/" target="_blank">Yatri
						Motorcycles</a>.
					Yatri Design Studio: <a href="https://yatrimotorcycles.com/">Yatri Motorcycles </a>,
                                <a href="https://www.yatrienergy.com/">Yatri Energy</a>.
					I received my Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from the <a
						href="https://pcampus.edu.np/" target="_blank">Institute of
						Engineering, Pulchowk Campus, Tribhuvan University</a>.
					I am seeking a research assistant position to work on embedded and computer science.<br>
					During my college days, I was a member of <a href="https://robotics.pcampus.edu.np/"
						target="_blank">Robotics Club</a> inside the
					college. Joining this club helped me boost my confidence and accelerate my skills in multiple
					fields.
					<br>
					Besides, I also got oppurtunity to develop my ledership skills, during my high school when I got
					elected as class
					representative and as college appointee the next year.
					I am also a decent basketball player and have played in multiple tournaments during my
					college days. Additionally, I
					enjoy doing free writing, painting, and reading novels.-->
					I am an embedded systems engineer with a fundamental foundation in vehicle software and a growing
					focus
					on intelligent, connected systems. Currently, I am pursuing the <a
						href="https://eminent-master.eu/"> Erasmus Mundus Joint Master’s in
						Embedded Intelligent Nanosystems Engineering (EMINENT)</a>, a program that has taken me across
					multiple
					European countries and deeply shaped both my technical skills and my perspective as an engineer.
				</p>

				<p>I completed my bachelor’s degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering at the <a
						href="https://pcampus.edu.np/" target="_blank">Institute of
						Engineering, Pulchowk Campus, Tribhuvan University</a>, Nepal. During this time, I was actively
					involved
					in the college <a href="https://robotics.pcampus.edu.np/" target="_blank">Robotics Club</a>, where I
					gained hands-on experience in PCB design, circuit fabrication,
					and robotics projects, and where I learned the value of teamwork, persistence, and learning by
					doing.</p>

				<!-- <p>Seeking to expand my technical horizon, I moved to Europe for my master’s degree. My academic
					journey has taken me through Greece, Germany, and France, exposing me to diverse teaching styles,
					research cultures, and collaborative environments. Through coursework and projects, I have worked
					with topics such as embedded systems, control, robotics, IoT/IIoT, and intelligent sensing, while
					also learning to adapt quickly, work across cultures, and manage complex technical challenges
					independently.</p> -->

					My professional journey began at <a href="https://yatrimotorcycles.com/" target="_blank">Yatri
						Motorcycles</a>, where I joined as an Embedded Systems Intern and
					later transitioned into a full-time Embedded Vehicle Software Engineer. There, I worked on
					real-world automotive systems, including the design and implementation of an Over-The-Air (OTA)
					firmware update system for electric motorcycles and charging stations. I also contributed to
					projects involving STM32-based firmware, internal servers for charging infrastructure, OBD flashing,
					and sensor integration. This experience grounded me in practical engineering and confirmed my
					interest in embedded systems at scale.

					I was involved in the Robotics Club, Pulchowk Campus, which participates in the annual <a
						href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABU_Robocon" target="_blank">ABU Robocon</a>. Here, I
					learned PCB designing, printing, and
					fabricating the circuits,
					along with some basics of programming. This experience inspired me to do various other projects
					related to robotics.
					<br>
					Furthermore, joining this club was immensely challenging for me due to the abysmal number of girls,
					along with no affiliation
					for the stay and lavatory for girls.

					While I was in my final years, I started learning Neural Networks. After taking a few courses and
					completing mini-projects, we did our Final Year Project using Deep Neural Networks. This started my
					interest in AI and machine learning as well.
					<br>
					In addition to that, I occasionally write blogs specifying the little snags during a project.
					Sometimes I
					do poetry too. I am also fascinated by the arts and literature. I enjoy outdoor activities like
					hiking,
					playing sports, sightseeing, and more. I am also an animal lover and a vegetarian.

					years. These interests keep me grounded and curious, both as an engineer and as a person.

					Looking ahead, I am motivated to work at the intersection of embedded systems, intelligent control,
					and
					real-world industrial or automotive applications. I am particularly interested in roles that combine
					strong engineering fundamentals with innovation, responsibility, and meaningful impact.
