				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<p class="major">
					Currently, I am an Embedded System Engineer-Vehicle Software, at <a
						href="https://yatrimotorcycles.com/">Yatri
						Motorcycles </a>.
					<!--Yatri Design Studio: <a href="https://yatrimotorcycles.com/">Yatri Motorcycles </a>,
                                <a href="https://www.yatrienergy.com/">Yatri Energy</a>.-->
					I received my Bachelor's degree in Electronics andCommunication Engineering from the Institute of
					Engineering, Pulchowk Campus, Tribhuvan University.
					I am seeking a research assistant position to work on embedded and computer science.<br>
					During my college days, I was a member of <a href="https://robotics.pcampus.edu.np/">Robotics Club
					</a> inside the
					college. Joining this club helped me boost my confidence and accelerate my skills in multiple
					fields.
					<br>
					Besides, I am also a decent basketball player and have played in multiple tournaments during my
					college days. Additionally, I
					enjoy doing free writing, painting, and reading novels.

					I joined Yatri Motorcycles, as an intern, during my last semester of undergrad. I was assigned an
					independent
					project named OTA (Over the Air Update), where the firmware in the bike had to be updated
					wirelessly. I created
					a simple prototype of this project during my intern period and have been working on it as a
					full-time embedded
					vehicle software engineer after my finals. So far, the complete system update firmware is
					completed and ready for deployment.
					<br>
					Besides my solo project, I am also working on multiple other, such as creating an internal server
					for charging stations, OBD (onboard diagnosis) firmware flash, and more.

					I was involved in the Robotics Club, Pulchowk Campus, which participates in the annual ABU Robocon,
					an Asian-Oceanian college robot competition. Here, I learned PCB designing, printing, and
					fabricating the circuits,
					along with some basics of programming. This experience inspired me to do various other projects
					related to robotics.
					<br>
					Furthermore, joining this club was immensely challenging for me due to the abysmal number of girls,
					along with no affiliation
					for the stay and lavatory for girls.

					While I was in my final years, I started learning Neural Networks. After taking a few courses and
					completing mini-projects, we did our Final Year Project using Deep Neural Networks. This started my
					interest in AI and machine learning as well.
					<br>
					In addition to that, I occasionally write blogs specifying the little snags during a project.
					Sometimes I
					do poetry too. I am also fascinated by the arts and literature. I enjoy outdoor activities like
					hiking,
					playing sports, sightseeing, and more. I am also an animal lover and a vegetarian.
